# Wayfinder@Yale
An iOS app that helps you navigate around Yale's new residential colleges fast. 

We realized that everyone was getting lost in the basement of the new colleges and decided to build an app to solve this problem.

## User Stories
* User can **search any place in a search bar and location will be highlighted
* User location is displayed on the map
